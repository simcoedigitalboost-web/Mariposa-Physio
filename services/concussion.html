                <h2>Concussion Rehabilitation</h2>
                <p>A concussion is a mild traumatic brain injury that can occur from a direct blow to the head, face, or neck, or from a force transmitted to the head from elsewhere in the body. While most concussions resolve within a few weeks, some people experience prolonged symptoms that require specialized treatment.</p>
                
                <p>At Mariposa Physiotherapy in Orillia, we provide comprehensive concussion assessment and rehabilitation. Our approach addresses the multiple systems that can be affected by concussion, including the vestibular system, cervical spine, vision, and exertion tolerance.</p>

                <h3>Concussion Symptoms We Treat:</h3>
                <p>Headaches and pressure in the head, dizziness and balance problems, difficulty concentrating or remembering, sensitivity to light and noise, fatigue and sleep disturbances, neck pain and stiffness, visual disturbances, and feeling "foggy" or "not right."</p>

                <h2>Our Concussion Treatment Approach</h2>
                
                <h3>Comprehensive Assessment</h3>
                <p>We begin with a thorough evaluation of your symptoms, including testing of your vestibular system, cervical spine, balance, and exertion tolerance. This helps us identify which systems are contributing to your symptoms and develop a targeted treatment plan.</p>

                <h3>Vestibular Rehabilitation</h3>
                <p>Many concussion symptoms relate to vestibular dysfunction. We use specific exercises and techniques to address dizziness, visual disturbances, and balance problems related to inner ear and vestibular system involvement.</p>

                <h3>Cervical Spine Treatment</h3>
                <p>The neck is often injured at the same time as a concussion and can contribute to headaches, dizziness, and other symptoms. We assess and treat cervical spine dysfunction using manual therapy and exercise.</p>

                <h3>Graduated Return to Activity</h3>
                <p>We guide you through a progressive return to physical activity, cognitive activity, school, work, and sport. This step-by-step approach ensures you don't push too hard too fast while also preventing prolonged over-rest.</p>

                <h3>Education and Support</h3>
                <p>Understanding your injury and recovery is an important part of treatment. We provide education about concussion, strategies for managing symptoms, and guidance on activity modification.</p>

                <h2>Vestibular Rehabilitation</h2>
                <p>Vestibular rehabilitation is a specialized form of physiotherapy for people experiencing dizziness, vertigo, and balance problems related to inner ear or vestibular system dysfunction. These symptoms can significantly impact quality of life and ability to perform daily activities.</p>
                
                <h3>Conditions We Treat:</h3>
                
                <h4>BPPV (Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo)</h4>
                <p>The most common cause of vertigo, BPPV occurs when small crystals in the inner ear become dislodged and move into the semicircular canals. This causes brief but intense spinning sensations triggered by head movements. BPPV can often be resolved in one to two treatment sessions using repositioning maneuvers.</p>

                <h4>Vestibular Neuritis and Labyrinthitis</h4>
                <p>These conditions involve inflammation of the inner ear or vestibular nerve, causing sudden severe vertigo, dizziness, and balance problems. Vestibular rehabilitation helps the brain compensate for the damaged inner ear function.</p>

                <h4>Meniere's Disease</h4>
                <p>A chronic inner ear condition causing episodes of vertigo, hearing loss, tinnitus, and ear fullness. While we cannot cure Meniere's disease, vestibular rehabilitation can help manage symptoms between episodes and improve overall function.</p>

                <h4>Age-Related Balance Problems</h4>
                <p>Balance naturally declines with age due to changes in the vestibular system, vision, and proprioception. Vestibular rehabilitation can help improve balance and reduce fall risk in older adults.</p>

                <h4>Post-Surgical Vestibular Dysfunction</h4>
                <p>Surgery involving the inner ear or acoustic nerve can affect vestibular function. Rehabilitation helps you adapt to these changes and regain balance and function.</p>

                <h2>What to Expect</h2>
                <p>Your first appointment includes a detailed history and comprehensive assessment of your vestibular function, balance, and related systems. Some tests may temporarily provoke your symptoms, but this is necessary to accurately diagnose your condition.</p>
                
                <p>Treatment typically involves specific exercises that you perform both in the clinic and at home. These exercises are designed to help your brain adapt to and compensate for vestibular dysfunction. The type of exercises depends on your specific diagnosis and symptoms.</p>

                <p>Many vestibular conditions respond well to treatment, with significant improvement often seen within a few weeks. Some conditions, like BPPV, can be resolved in just a few sessions.</p>
