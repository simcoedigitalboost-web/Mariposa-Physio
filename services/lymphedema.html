                <h2>Understanding Lymphedema</h2>
                <p>Lymphedema is swelling that occurs when the lymphatic system is unable to adequately drain fluid from body tissues. This most commonly affects the arms or legs, though it can occur in other areas of the body.</p>
                
                <p>Lymphedema is categorized as either primary (occurring without a known cause) or secondary (resulting from damage to the lymphatic system). Secondary lymphedema commonly occurs after cancer treatment, particularly when lymph nodes have been removed or damaged by surgery or radiation.</p>

                <p>At Mariposa Physiotherapy in Orillia, Kelly Spears is a certified Combined Decongestive Therapist (CDT) with specialized training in lymphedema management. She is also a registered Authorizer for the Government Assistive Devices Program (ADP) for lymphedema garments, meaning she can assess you for and authorize funding for compression garments.</p>

                <h2>Combined Decongestive Therapy (CDT)</h2>
                <p>Combined Decongestive Therapy is the gold standard treatment for lymphedema. This comprehensive approach includes multiple components working together to reduce swelling and help you manage your condition long-term.</p>
                
                <h3>Manual Lymphatic Drainage (MLD)</h3>
                <p>A specialized gentle massage technique that stimulates the lymphatic system to move fluid from congested areas to regions where it can drain normally. Unlike traditional massage, MLD uses very light pressure and specific directional movements.</p>

                <h3>Compression Therapy</h3>
                <p>Multi-layer compression bandaging during the intensive treatment phase helps maintain the reduction achieved through MLD. Once your limb has been reduced to its optimal size, you transition to wearing compression garments for ongoing maintenance.</p>

                <h3>Exercise</h3>
                <p>Specific exercises performed while wearing compression help pump fluid out of the affected limb and maintain joint mobility. We develop an individualized exercise program appropriate for your condition and fitness level.</p>

                <h3>Skin Care</h3>
                <p>Proper skin care is essential to prevent infections that can worsen lymphedema. We educate you on skin care protocols and what signs to watch for.</p>

                <h3>Compression Device Therapy</h3>
                <p>We recently introduced advanced compression therapy devices that provide sequential pneumatic compression. This technology is effective for muscle recovery, swelling reduction, and complements manual lymph drainage treatments.</p>

                <h2>ADP Compression Garment Authorization</h2>
                <p>The Assistive Devices Program (ADP) provides funding assistance for compression garments for eligible Ontario residents with lymphedema. As a registered ADP Authorizer, Kelly can assess your need for compression garments and complete the authorization paperwork.</p>
                
                <p>This service can significantly reduce the out-of-pocket cost of compression garments, which need to be replaced regularly to maintain their effectiveness. We work with local compression garment suppliers to ensure you receive properly fitted garments.</p>

                <h2>Cancer Rehabilitation</h2>
                <p>Cancer and its treatments can have significant physical effects beyond lymphedema. At Mariposa Physiotherapy, we provide comprehensive rehabilitation support for people during and after cancer treatment.</p>
                
                <h3>Our Cancer Rehabilitation Services Include:</h3>
                <p>Management of treatment-related fatigue through appropriate exercise prescription, addressing range of motion limitations following surgery or radiation, scar tissue management, strengthening programs to rebuild fitness after treatment, and support for returning to normal activities and exercise.</p>

                <p>We understand that a cancer diagnosis affects every aspect of your life. Our approach is compassionate and individualized, meeting you where you are and supporting your recovery goals.</p>

                <h2>Living Well with Lymphedema</h2>
                <p>While lymphedema is a chronic condition, it can be effectively managed. With proper treatment and self-care, most people with lymphedema can maintain good limb health and continue their normal activities.</p>
                
                <p>We emphasize education and self-management skills so you can take control of your condition. This includes teaching you self-massage techniques, proper bandaging if needed, exercise programs, and what precautions to take to protect your affected limb.</p>
