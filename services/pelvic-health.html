                <h2>What is Pelvic Floor Physiotherapy?</h2>
                <p>Pelvic health physiotherapy is a specialized area within physical therapy focusing on the assessment and rehabilitation of the pelvic floor muscles. These muscles play a crucial role in bladder and bowel control, sexual function, and core stability.</p>
                
                <p>Many people suffer in silence with pelvic floor issues, not realizing that effective treatment is available. At Mariposa Physiotherapy in Orillia, our trained pelvic health physiotherapist provides compassionate, evidence-based care in a private treatment room.</p>

                <p>Kelly Spears is registered with the College of Physiotherapists of Ontario to perform internal pelvic examinations, allowing for thorough assessment and targeted treatment of pelvic floor dysfunction.</p>

                <h2>Conditions We Treat</h2>
                
                <h3>Urinary Incontinence</h3>
                <p>Leaking urine when you cough, sneeze, laugh, or exercise (stress incontinence) is common but not normal. Urge incontinence, the sudden strong need to urinate, and mixed incontinence can also be effectively treated with pelvic floor physiotherapy. Many patients see significant improvement or complete resolution of symptoms.</p>

                <h3>Pelvic Pain</h3>
                <p>Chronic pelvic pain can significantly impact quality of life. We treat conditions including vulvodynia, vaginismus, dyspareunia (painful intercourse), pudendal neuralgia, and chronic prostatitis in men. Our approach addresses both the physical and functional aspects of pelvic pain.</p>

                <h3>Pelvic Organ Prolapse</h3>
                <p>When pelvic organs descend due to weakened support structures, physiotherapy can help strengthen the pelvic floor and improve symptoms. We provide conservative management strategies and work alongside your healthcare team if surgical intervention is being considered.</p>

                <h3>Prenatal Care</h3>
                <p>Pregnancy places significant demands on the pelvic floor and core. Prenatal pelvic floor physiotherapy can help you prepare for delivery, address pregnancy-related pain, and learn techniques to protect your pelvic floor during birth.</p>

                <h3>Postnatal Recovery</h3>
                <p>Whether you had a vaginal delivery or cesarean section, your body needs time and support to recover. We assess and treat diastasis recti (abdominal separation), perineal scarring, and help restore core and pelvic floor function after childbirth.</p>

                <h3>Male Pelvic Health</h3>
                <p>Men also experience pelvic floor dysfunction. We treat post-prostatectomy incontinence, chronic pelvic pain syndrome, and other male pelvic health conditions with the same evidence-based approach.</p>

                <h2>What to Expect at Your Appointment</h2>
                <p>Your first pelvic health appointment begins with a detailed discussion of your symptoms, medical history, and goals. We understand these issues can be sensitive to discuss, and we create a safe, judgment-free environment.</p>
                
                <p>Assessment may include external observation of posture and movement, as well as internal examination of the pelvic floor muscles with your consent. Internal examination allows us to accurately assess muscle tone, strength, coordination, and identify any areas of tension or tenderness.</p>

                <p>Based on your assessment, we develop a personalized treatment plan that may include pelvic floor exercises (which are not always Kegels), manual therapy techniques, bladder or bowel retraining strategies, education on lifestyle factors, and home exercise programs.</p>

                <p>All assessments and treatments are performed in a private treatment room to ensure your comfort and confidentiality.</p>

                <h2>You Don't Have to Live With These Symptoms</h2>
                <p>Many people believe that leaking urine after childbirth or with aging is just something they have to accept. This is not true. Pelvic floor physiotherapy has excellent outcomes for many pelvic health conditions.</p>
                
                <p>If you're experiencing any pelvic floor symptoms, we encourage you to seek assessment. Early intervention often leads to better outcomes, though it's never too late to benefit from treatment.</p>
