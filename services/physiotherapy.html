                <h2>Advanced Manual Therapy</h2>
                <p>Manual therapy is a specialized area of physiotherapy for the management of neuromusculoskeletal conditions. It involves highly specific hands-on treatment approaches including joint mobilization, manipulation, and soft tissue techniques.</p>
                
                <p>Our physiotherapists have completed post-graduate studies through the Orthopaedic Division of the Ontario Physiotherapy Association and affiliated university-level training programs. Kelly Spears holds the designation of Fellow of the Canadian Academy of Manual and Manipulative Physiotherapy (FCAMPT), representing the highest level of advanced orthopaedic training a physiotherapist can achieve in Canada.</p>

                <h3>Our Manual Therapy Approach Includes:</h3>
                <p>Joint mobilization and manipulation to restore proper mechanics, soft tissue release techniques to address muscular tension and adhesions, therapeutic exercise prescription tailored to your specific condition, postural assessment and correction strategies, and education on self-management techniques for lasting results.</p>

                <h2>Conditions We Treat</h2>
                
                <h3>Back and Neck Pain</h3>
                <p>Whether you're dealing with acute injury or chronic pain, our therapists use evidence-based assessment to identify the source of your symptoms and develop a targeted treatment plan. We treat disc injuries, sciatica, facet joint dysfunction, muscle strains, and postural-related pain.</p>

                <h3>Sports Injuries</h3>
                <p>From weekend warriors to competitive athletes, we provide comprehensive assessment, treatment, and rehabilitation to get you back to your sport safely. We treat sprains, strains, tendinopathies, and overuse injuries affecting any part of the body.</p>

                <h3>Post-Surgical Rehabilitation</h3>
                <p>Recovery after surgery requires specialized care. We work with patients following joint replacements (hip, knee, shoulder), ACL reconstruction, rotator cuff repair, spinal surgery, and other orthopaedic procedures. Our goal is to restore your function and help you return to your normal activities.</p>

                <h3>Motor Vehicle Accident Injuries</h3>
                <p>Car accidents can cause complex injuries including whiplash, soft tissue trauma, and musculoskeletal dysfunction. We provide comprehensive treatment covered under your auto insurance and work with you through the entire recovery process.</p>

                <h3>Work-Related Injuries</h3>
                <p>We treat WSIB-covered injuries and develop return-to-work programs tailored to your job demands. Our goal is to get you back to work safely while preventing re-injury.</p>

                <h3>Joint Pain and Arthritis</h3>
                <p>Osteoarthritis and other joint conditions respond well to physiotherapy. We offer the GLA:D Canada program, an evidence-based education and exercise program specifically designed for people with hip or knee osteoarthritis.</p>

                <h2>What to Expect</h2>
                <p>Your first physiotherapy appointment at Mariposa begins with a thorough assessment. Your therapist will review your medical history, discuss your symptoms and goals, and perform physical tests to identify the factors contributing to your problem.</p>
                
                <p>Based on these findings, we develop a personalized treatment plan that typically includes hands-on manual therapy, therapeutic exercises you can do at home, education about your condition, and strategies for preventing recurrence.</p>

                <p>Treatment sessions are typically 30-45 minutes, allowing adequate time for both hands-on treatment and exercise instruction. We believe in quality over quantity, focusing on getting you better as efficiently as possible.</p>
