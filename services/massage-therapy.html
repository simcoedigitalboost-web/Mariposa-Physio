                <h2>Massage Therapy at Mariposa</h2>
                <p>Our Registered Massage Therapist (RMT) works collaboratively with the physiotherapy team to provide comprehensive care. This integrated approach means your massage therapist and physiotherapist communicate about your treatment, ensuring coordinated care without duplication of services.</p>
                
                <p>Marie Picard, our RMT, graduated from the Canadian College of Massage and Hydrotherapy and is a registered member of the College of Massage Therapists of Ontario. She brings a special interest in functional movement and posture, focusing on addressing the root causes of your discomfort rather than just treating symptoms.</p>

                <p>Marie believes in empowering her clients to participate in their own healing through education and support. Be prepared for some homework to accelerate your recovery process.</p>

                <h2>Benefits of Massage Therapy</h2>
                
                <h3>Pain Reduction</h3>
                <p>Massage therapy is effective for reducing many types of pain including back pain, neck pain, headaches, and muscle soreness. By releasing tension in muscles and improving circulation, massage can provide both immediate relief and long-term benefits.</p>

                <h3>Muscle Tension Relief</h3>
                <p>Whether from stress, poor posture, repetitive activities, or athletic training, muscle tension can cause discomfort and limit movement. Massage therapy helps release tight muscles and restore normal tissue mobility.</p>

                <h3>Improved Range of Motion</h3>
                <p>Tight muscles and fascial restrictions can limit your movement. Massage therapy helps restore flexibility and range of motion, making it easier to perform daily activities and exercise.</p>

                <h3>Injury Recovery</h3>
                <p>Massage therapy supports the healing process after injury by improving circulation, reducing scar tissue formation, and maintaining muscle flexibility during recovery.</p>

                <h3>Stress Reduction</h3>
                <p>Chronic stress contributes to many health problems including muscle tension, headaches, and pain. Massage therapy activates the relaxation response, reducing stress hormones and promoting a sense of calm.</p>

                <h3>Tissue Adhesion Release</h3>
                <p>After injury or surgery, scar tissue and adhesions can form that restrict movement and cause pain. Massage therapy techniques can help break down these adhesions and restore normal tissue mobility.</p>

                <h2>Specialized Techniques</h2>
                <p>Marie has acquired additional certifications to enhance her skills and offer more treatment options.</p>
                
                <h3>Cupping Therapy</h3>
                <p>This traditional technique uses suction cups placed on the skin to increase blood flow, reduce muscle tension, and promote healing. Cupping is effective for back pain, neck pain, and muscle tightness, and can leave temporary circular marks on the skin.</p>

                <h3>Dynamic Taping</h3>
                <p>Unlike rigid athletic tape, dynamic tape is designed to provide support while allowing movement. It can be used to offload stressed tissues, provide feedback for posture correction, and support injured areas during activity and recovery.</p>

                <h3>Advanced Neurological Techniques</h3>
                <p>Marie has completed specialized training in neurological techniques, allowing her to offer interactive custom treatments for neurological symptom management. This unique skillset is particularly valuable for clients with complex conditions.</p>

                <h3>Autism Spectrum Disorder Certification</h3>
                <p>Marie has completed certification regarding Autism Spectrum Disorder, offering adapted massage therapy approaches for individuals on the spectrum. This specialized training allows her to provide comfortable, effective treatment for clients who may have sensory sensitivities or other specific needs.</p>

                <h2>What to Expect</h2>
                <p>Your first massage therapy appointment begins with a discussion of your health history, current concerns, and treatment goals. Marie will assess your posture and movement patterns to understand the factors contributing to your symptoms.</p>
                
                <p>Treatment is performed on a comfortable massage table. You will be properly draped throughout the treatment, with only the area being worked on exposed. Communication is important, so please let Marie know about your comfort level, pressure preferences, and any areas you want focused on or avoided.</p>

                <p>After treatment, you may receive recommendations for stretches, exercises, or self-care techniques to continue your progress at home. Marie believes in teaching you to manage your own health, not creating dependency on treatment.</p>

                <h3>Appointment Length</h3>
                <p>Massage therapy appointments are available in 30, 45, 60, and 90-minute sessions. The appropriate length depends on your condition and treatment goals. Marie can advise on the best option for your situation.</p>
