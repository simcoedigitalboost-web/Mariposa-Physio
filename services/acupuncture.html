                <h2>What is Acupuncture?</h2>
                <p>Acupuncture is the insertion of thin, sterile needles through the skin into specific points on the body. This ancient practice has been used for thousands of years and is now supported by modern research for the treatment of various pain conditions and musculoskeletal problems.</p>
                
                <p>At Mariposa Physiotherapy in Orillia, our physiotherapists use acupuncture as part of a comprehensive treatment approach. Kelly Spears has been certified through Acupuncture Canada for over 23 years and is registered with the College of Physiotherapists of Ontario to perform acupuncture.</p>

                <p>When performed by a trained physiotherapist, acupuncture is integrated with your overall treatment plan, complementing manual therapy and exercise to enhance your recovery.</p>

                <h2>How Does Acupuncture Work?</h2>
                <p>Modern research suggests acupuncture works through several mechanisms. The insertion of needles stimulates the nervous system, triggering the release of natural pain-relieving chemicals including endorphins. Acupuncture also increases local blood flow, reduces inflammation, and can help relax tight muscles.</p>
                
                <p>From a traditional perspective, acupuncture is believed to restore the flow of energy (qi) through pathways in the body called meridians. Whether you prefer the modern scientific explanation or the traditional understanding, the clinical results speak for themselves.</p>

                <p>Acupuncture is generally very well tolerated. The needles used are extremely thin, much finer than needles used for injections or blood draws. Most people feel little to no discomfort during treatment and find the experience relaxing.</p>

                <h2>Conditions Treated with Acupuncture</h2>
                
                <h3>Musculoskeletal Pain</h3>
                <p>Acupuncture is effective for many types of musculoskeletal pain including back pain, neck pain, shoulder pain, and joint pain. It can be particularly helpful for chronic pain conditions that have not responded fully to other treatments.</p>

                <h3>Headaches and Migraines</h3>
                <p>Research supports acupuncture for the prevention and treatment of tension-type headaches and migraines. Regular treatment may reduce the frequency and intensity of headaches.</p>

                <h3>Muscle Tension and Trigger Points</h3>
                <p>Acupuncture, including a technique called dry needling, can effectively release tight muscles and trigger points that contribute to pain and restricted movement.</p>

                <h3>Tendinopathies</h3>
                <p>Conditions like tennis elbow, golfer's elbow, Achilles tendinopathy, and rotator cuff tendinopathy often respond well to acupuncture as part of a comprehensive treatment approach.</p>

                <h3>Osteoarthritis</h3>
                <p>Acupuncture can help manage pain and improve function in people with osteoarthritis, particularly of the knee.</p>

                <h3>Post-Surgical Pain</h3>
                <p>Acupuncture may help manage pain during recovery from surgery, potentially reducing the need for pain medications.</p>

                <h2>What to Expect</h2>
                <p>During your treatment, thin sterile needles are inserted at specific points. The number of needles and their location depends on your condition. Needles are typically left in place for 15 to 30 minutes while you rest comfortably.</p>
                
                <p>You may feel a slight pinch as each needle is inserted, followed by sensations of heaviness, tingling, or warmth around the needle. Many people find acupuncture treatment deeply relaxing and some even fall asleep during sessions.</p>

                <p>The number of treatments needed varies depending on your condition. Acute conditions may respond quickly, while chronic conditions often require a series of treatments. Your physiotherapist will discuss a treatment plan based on your individual situation.</p>

                <p>Acupuncture is very safe when performed by a trained practitioner. Side effects are rare and typically minor, such as slight bruising at needle sites.</p>

                <h2>Integrated Treatment Approach</h2>
                <p>At Mariposa Physiotherapy, acupuncture is not offered as a standalone treatment. Instead, it is integrated with your physiotherapy care to enhance results. Your treatment session may include acupuncture alongside manual therapy, exercise instruction, and education.</p>
                
                <p>This integrated approach allows us to address your condition from multiple angles, often achieving better outcomes than any single treatment approach alone.</p>
